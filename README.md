# US Real Estate Rental Business Model

As part of my Master's Course project, me and my classmates took up an ML project to solve the rising Real Estate Problems in the US, by providing highly accurate estimates of rental values of various properties to invest in.

The predictive model we built can be beneficial to real estate firms planning to expand their current
business by investing in buying new properties and rolling out a rental business model, similar to
Airbnb.

Our model can act as a core profit driver for the firms as they plan to invest in select properties
that have a promising return on investment (ROI). And our model predicts just the right indicator
of profitability, i.e., perfect_rating_score which predicts whether or not a particular property listing
is likely to have a high chance of getting a perfect rating score. Therefore the predictive model will
act as a great guide in the business decision-making process of investing only in those properties
that will have a high ROI.

## Business actions:
On the other hand, the predictive model will also provide further insights into the specific features
of different properties that translate into the company’s profits. For instance, if we find out that
‘host_is_superhost’ predictor has a significant weightage in predicting the accurate
perfect_rating_score for a given listing, then the firm can translate the same into their business
decisions. That is, they can ensure that the owners of their property listings follow a certain
protocol that aligns with the objective of turning them into a super host, and overall, driving the
company’s profits.

## Value of the predictions:
By utilizing the power of our predictive model, Airbnb, and similar firms can further expand their
businesses in new geographical locations across the world. They don’t have to take the risk of a
failed expansion resulting from uncertainty of various factors pertaining to the new location. By
augmenting more variables relating to these factors, we can make the current predictive model
adjust to the new location and therefore drive those predictions with a high perfect_rating_score
to exactly find those properties that have a high probability of resulting in a perfect rating score in
the future; if bought and rented out as a listing.

However, it is to be noted that since the model’s True positive rate (TPR) is not very significant
we cannot entirely rely on the positive ‘Yes’ predictions to make a decision of buying out a
property. We would need to consider a lot of other market factors as well. However, since our
model has a low False positive rate (FPR) of < 10%, it significantly reduces the risk of buying out
those properties that would otherwise result in a bad rating score and thereby result in a potential
loss for the company. This means that our model can support a risk-averse business strategy for
incumbent firms that are trying to survive in the market.
